Maven Displaying problems in eclips:-
From Eclipse go to to Window -> Preferences -> Maven (expand) -> Errors/Warnings.The last option reads "Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration" - use the drop-down menu for this option and toggle "Ignore", then Apply, then OK. (At "Requires updating Maven Projects" prompt say OK).
